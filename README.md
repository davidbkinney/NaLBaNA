# NaLBaNA (Natural Langugae to Bayesian Network Agent)

NaLBaNA is a Python package that allows users to input natural language prompts
the describe causal systems and generate Bayesian networks that represent the 
causal dynamics of system described by those prompts. 

The package assumes that users will have decent familiarity with the theory
of Bayesian networks and the do-calculus. For a concise introduction to Bayesian
networks, see Section 3.1 of Sprites, P. (2010) ["Introduction to Causal Inference"](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume11/spirtes10a/spirtes10a.pdf])
JMLR 11: 1643-1662. For a similarly concise introduction to the do-calculus, see Huang, M. and M. Valtorta. (2012)
